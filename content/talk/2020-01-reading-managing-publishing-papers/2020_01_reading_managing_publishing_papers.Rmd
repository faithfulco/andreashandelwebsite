* [Research impact challenge](https://blog.impactstory.org/impact-challenge-day-1-academia-edu/), also see [this pdf book](http://blog.impactstory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/impact_challenge_ebook_links.pdf). It's a bit outdated and recommends things I'm not too fond of (e.g. Academia.edu/ResearchGate), but has still some nice information.
