## Motivation

* You will likely have many jobs throughout your career.
* Freelance/self-employed jobs keep growing.
* Most good jobs (and other opportunities) are found through connections.
* **Think of yourself as a "brand".**

```{r brand,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap='', out.width = '70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./brand.jpg")
```


## Motivation

* People (potential collaborators, employers, employees, etc.) will look you up online.
* If you don't control your online presence, you are at the mercy of what shows up.

```{r embarassing,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap='', out.width = '70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./embarassing.jpg")
```



## How to build and manage your brand
* Create and curate an online presence.
* Create and curate content.
* Be consistent with your _brand identity_ (e.g. only publish high-quality work).

## Ways to build and manage your online presence
* General sites
* Academia/Science specific sites
* Self-built site(s)



# General Sites

## LinkedIn

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
```{r linkedin,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap='', out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./linkedin.jpg")
```

* **The** professional networking site. Almost required to be on there. 
* You can customize your profile a good bit.
* A good way to showcase yourself.
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
* Great for finding/connecting with others.
* LinkedIn is useful even if you are not looking for a job!
* Build a good profile early, not a week before you start applying.
* Some features require a subscription.
</div>


## Twitter
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
```{r twitter,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap='', out.width = '60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./twitter.jpg")
```

* Lots of scientists use Twitter. 
* Great for learning about new developments in your field.
</div>


<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
* Good for announcing your own accomplishments.
* Good networking tool.
* Need to be used (active and/or passive) for it to be useful. 
* Need to decide if you want to mix professional and personal. 
* You can create/use multiple accounts.
</div>



## GitHub
* A great tool to manage projects and work collaboratively.
* Great way to showcase any 'products' you've made.
* Lets you create simple websites fairly easily.
* Somewhat technical, takes time to get used to it.
* Showing you know/use GitHub is a desirable skill by itself.
* [Great perks for students](https://education.github.com/pack).


## Instagram
* Focus is on posting images.
* I have little experience.
* I don't think it's much used in academia, but might be useful in science outreach.

## Facebook
* _Everyone_ is on it.
* Good way to stay connected with folks.
* Some educators use Facebook groups for classes.
* Hard to keep professional and personal lives separated (unless you create 2 accounts).

## YouTube
* Good for teaching, also useful for outreach.
* You can create your own channels for specific projects.
* [Example - Jeff Leek](https://www.youtube.com/user/jtleek2007)

```{r youtube,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap='', out.width = '60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./youtube.jpg")
```


# Academia/Science specific sites

## Academia/Science specific sites
* Google Scholar
* ORCID
* ResearchGate
* Academia.edu
* Mendeley
* ImpactStory
* Publons
* ...

## Google Scholar 
* Only for publications (broadly speaking).
* Gives citation metrics.
* Is fairly automated, you have to do very little.
* Great way to keep track of your papers.

_If I want to get a quick idea who someone "is" in academia, I check their Google Scholar page._

## ORCID
* Gives you a unique ID to track your research productivity.
* Used by a lot of journals.
* Very useful if you have a (slightly) common name (but even if not).
* Free and not-for-profit.

## ResearchGate/Academia/Mendeley/etc.
* All are versions of academic social network sites.
* All are commercial.
* You have various levels of control of how your profile looks like.
* Sites are trying to encourage interactions.

_I deleted all my accounts on those sites since I don't like/trust the companies owning the sites and want to control my web presence myself._

## ImpactStory/Kudos/Publons/etc. 
* Sites that try to measure your 'impact'.
* Maybe fun, but I haven't found them too useful yet.


## Own website
* You have complete control.
* You have to build and maintain it yourself.
* Lot's of ways to do that. Many are free.
* We'll do that in a separate session.


# Create content

## Create content
* Tweet/re-tweet
* Write blog posts
* Create videos
* ...

## General tips
* You don't need to duplicate, e.g. you can link to your Google Scholar publications from LinkedIn.
* Make sure you keep things reasonable updated.
* Set Google alerts for your name (or other keywords).


## Resources

* [The A to Z of social media for academia](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/a-z-social-media)

* [Research impact challenge](https://blog.impactstory.org/impact-challenge-day-1-academia-edu/), also see [this pdf book](http://blog.impactstory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/impact_challenge_ebook_links.pdf). It's a bit outdated and recommends things I'm not too fond of (e.g. Academia.edu/ResearchGate), but has still some nice information.
