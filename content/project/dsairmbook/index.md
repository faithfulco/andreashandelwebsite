[An online draft - really more of a skeleton/outline - of a book convering simulation models for immunology and related disciplines.](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRMbook/) 


I had (and still occasionally have) the plan of writing such a book. I'm currently not convinced the cost-benefit analysis is worth doing this. So for now, until I change my mind, this is dormant. Related maybe useful material is an [introduction on that topic I wrote with co-authors](), which was published in Nature Reviews Immunology in 2019. A lot of the material which a future book would cover is also contained in my [DSAIRM R packge](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRM/).
