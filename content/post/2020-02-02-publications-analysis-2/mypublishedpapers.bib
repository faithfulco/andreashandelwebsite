	abstract = {Background: As immunology continues to become more quantitative, increasingly sophisticated computational tools are commonly used. One useful toolset are simulation models. Becoming familiar with such models and their uses generally requires writing computer code early in the learning process. This poses a barrier for individuals who do not have prior coding experience.
Results: To help reduce this barrier, I wrote software that teaches the use of mechanistic simulation models to study infection and immune response dynamics, without the need to read or write computer code. The software, called Dynamical Systems Approach to Immune Response Modeling (DSAIRM), is implemented as a freely available package for the R programming language. The target audience are immunologists and other scientists with no or little coding experience. DSAIRM provides a hands-on introduction to simulation models, teaches the basics of those models and what they can be used for. Here, I describe the DSAIRM R package, explain the different ways the package can be used, and provide a few introductory examples.
Conclusions: Working through DSAIRM will equip individuals with the knowledge needed to critically assess studies using simulation models in the published literature and will help them understand when such a modeling approach might be suitable for their own research. DSAIRM also provides users a potential starting point towards development and use of simulation models in their own research.},

	abstract = {Directly observed therapy (DOT) is almost universally used for the treatment of TB. Several meta-analyses using different methods have assessed the effectiveness of DOT compared to self-administered therapy (SAT). The results of these meta-analyses often conflict with some concluding DOT is superior and others that there is little or no difference. Meta-analyses can guide policymaking, but such analyses must be reliable. To assess the validity of a previous meta-analysis, we tried to reproduce it. We encountered problems with the previous analysis that did not allow for a meaningful reproduction. We describe the issues we encountered here. We then performed a new meta-analysis comparing the treatment outcomes of adults given treatment with SAT versus DOT. Outcomes in the new analysis are loss to follow-up, treatment failure, cure, treatment completed, and all-cause mortality. All data, documentation, and code used to generate our results is provided. Our new analysis included four randomized and three observational studies with 1603 and 1626 individuals respectively. The pooled relative risks (RR) are as follows: Lost to follow-up (RR = 1.2, 95\% CI 0.9, 1.7), Treatment Failure (RR = 1.1, 95\% CI 0.6, 2), Cure (RR = 0.9, 95\% CI 0.8, 1.1), Treatment Completion (RR = 1, 95\% CI 0.9, 1.1), Mortality (RR = 0.9, 95\% CI 0.6, 1.3). Based on data from our new meta-analysis, the magnitude of the difference between DOT and SAT for all reported outcomes is small, and none of the differences are statistically significant.},

	abstract = {Background.  Avian influenza A H7N9 (A/H7N9) is characterized by rapid progressive pneumonia and respiratory failure. Mortality among laboratory-confirmed cases is above 30\%; however, the clinical course of disease is variable and patients at high risk for death are not well characterized.
Methods.  We obtained demographic, clinical, and laboratory information on all A/H7N9 patients in Zhejiang province from China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention electronic databases. Risk factors for death were identified using logistic regression and a risk score was created using regression coefficients from multivariable models. We externally validated this score in an independent cohort from Jiangsu province.
Results.  Among 305 A/H7N9 patients, 115 (37.7\%) died. Four independent predictors of death were identified: older age, diabetes, bilateral lung infection, and neutrophil percentage. We constructed a score with 0–13 points. Mortality rates in low- (0–3), medium- (4–6), and high-risk (7–13) groups were 4.6\%, 32.1\%, and 62.7\% (Ptrend {\textless} .0001). In a validation cohort of 111 A/H7N9 patients, 61 (55\%) died. Mortality rates in low-, medium-, and high-risk groups were 35.5\%, 55.8, and 67.4\% (Ptrend = .0063).
Conclusions.  We developed and validated a simple-to-use, predictive risk score for clinical use, identifying patients at high mortality risk.},

	abstract = {Methods: We prospectively recruited 300 students at a university health clinic who presented with cough and 1 inﬂuenza-like illness symptom between December 2016 and February 2017 to receive care guided by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Of the 300 patients receiving the PCR test, 264 had complete medical records and were compared to 771 who received usual care. We used a logistic regression model to identify whether PCR guided care was associated with guideline consistent care, based on the appropriate use of oseltamivir and antibiotics. We also assessed whether PCR guided care decreased the likelihood of return visits within 2 weeks by patients.
Results: Logistic regression revealed that the odds of receiving guideline supported care did not signiﬁcantly increase for patients who received PCR guided care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.24; 95\% CI, 0.83–1.88). It signiﬁcantly decreased the likelihood of an antibiotic prescription (aOR, 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.40 – 0.94), increased the likelihood of receiving oseltamivir (aOR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.09 –2.28), and decreased the likelihood of return visit within 2 weeks (aOR, 0.19; 95\% CI, 0.04 – 0.81).
Conclusions: The use of a rapid PCR test did not signiﬁcantly improve the likelihood of guideline consistent care. However, independent of test outcome, patients who received the test were more likely to receive an antiviral and less likely to receive an antibiotic or have a return visit within 2 weeks.

The application of these methods, however, is restricted due to various assumptions required by these models. When the number of observations per subject is sufficiently large, and individual trajectories are noisy, functional data analysis (FDA) methods serve as an alternative to parametric longitudinal data analysis techniques. However, the use of FDA in RCTs is rare. In this paper, the effectiveness of FDA and linear mixed models (LMMs) was compared by analyzing data from rural persons living with HIV and comorbid depression enrolled in a depression treatment randomized clinical trial. Interactive voice response systems were used for weekly administrations of the 10item Self-Administered Depression Scale (SADS) over 41 weeks. Functional principal component analysis and functional regression analysis methods detected a statistically significant difference in SADS between telphone-administered interpersonal psychotherapy (tele-IPT) and controls but linear mixed effects model results did not. Additional simulation studies were conducted to compare FDA and LMMs under a different nonlinear trajectory assumption. In this clinical trial with sufficient per subject measured outcomes and individual trajectories that are noisy and nonlinear, we found FDA methods to be a better alternative to LMMs.},

	abstract = {Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.},

	abstract = {The current influenza vaccine provides narrow protection against the strains included in the vaccine, and needs to be reformulated every few years in response to the constantly evolving new strains. Novel approaches are directed toward developing vaccines that provide broader protection by targeting B and T cell epitopes that are conserved between different strains of the virus. In this paper, we focus on developing mathematical models to explore the CD8 T cell responses to influenza, how they can be boosted, and the conditions under which they contribute to protection. Our models suggest that the interplay between spatial heterogeneity (with the virus infecting the respiratory tract and the immune response being generated in the secondary lymphoid organs) and T cell differentiation (with proliferation occurring in the lymphoid organs giving rise to a subpopulation of resident T cells in the respiratory tract) is the key to understand the dynamics of protection afforded by the CD8 T cell response to influenza. Our results suggest that the time lag for the generation of resident T cells in the respiratory tract and their rate of decay following infection are the key factors that limit the efficacy of CD8 T cell responses. The models predict that an increase in the level of central memory T cells leads to a gradual decrease in the viral load, and, in contrast, there is a sharper protection threshold for the relationship between the size of the population of resident T cells and protection. The models also suggest that repeated natural influenza infections cause the number of central memory CD8 T cells and the peak number of resident memory CD8 T cells to reach their plateaus, and while the former is maintained, the latter decays with time since the most recent infection.},

	abstract = {Background: Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and foodborne diarrheal disease in the United States. Norovirus vaccine development has progressed in recent years, but critical questions remain regarding which age groups should be vaccinated to maximize population impact.
Methods: We developed a deterministic, age-structured compartmental model of norovirus transmission and immunity in the U.S. population. The model was ﬁt to age-speciﬁc monthly U.S. hospitalizations between 1996 and 2007. We simulated mass immunization of both pediatric and elderly populations assuming realistic coverages of 90\% and 65\%, respectively. We considered two mechanism of vaccine action, resulting in lower vaccine efﬁcacy (lVE) between 22\% and 43\% and higher VE (hVE) of 50\%.
Results: Pediatric vaccination was predicted to avert 33\% (95\% CI: 27\%, 40\%) and 60\% (95\% CI: 49\%, 71\%) of norovirus episodes among children under ﬁve years for lVE and hVE, respectively. Vaccinating the elderly averted 17\% (95\% CI: 12\%, 20\%) and 38\% (95\% CI: 34\%, 42\%) of cases in 65+ year olds for lVE and hVE, respectively. At a population level, pediatric vaccination was predicted to avert 18–21 times more cases and twice as many deaths per vaccinee compared to elderly vaccination.
Conclusions: The potential beneﬁts are likely greater for a pediatric program, both via direct protection of vaccinated children and indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals, including adults and the elderly. These ﬁndings argue for a clinical development plan that will deliver a vaccine with a safety and efﬁcacy proﬁle suitable for use in children.},

To date, no pandemic emergence of a new influenza strain has been preceded by detection of a closely related precursor in an animal or human. Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic risk posed by a detected virus. The goal would be to use genetic sequence and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize pandemic prevention or response measures. We describe such efforts, identify progress and ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity, hemagglutinin pH of activation, and polymerase complex efficiency) that contribute to pandemic risk.},

	abstract = {Background: Delay in tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis adversely affects patients’ outcomes and prolongs transmission in the community. The influence of social contacts on steps taken by active pulmonary TB patients to seek a diagnosis has not been well examined.
Methods: A retrospective study design was use to enroll TB patients on treatment for 3 months or less and aged ≥18 years from 3 public clinics in Kampala, Uganda, from March to July 2014. Social network analysis was used to collect information about social contacts and health providers visited by patients to measure the number of steps and time between onset of symptoms and final diagnosis of TB.
Results: Of 294 TB patients, 58 \% were male and median age was 30 (IQR: 24–38) years. The median number of steps was 4 (IQR: 3, 7) corresponding to 70 (IQR: 28,140) days to diagnosis. New patients had more steps and time to diagnosis compared retreatment patients (5 vs. 3, P {\textless} 0.0001; 84 vs. 46 days P {\textless} 0.0001). Fifty-eight percent of patients first contacted persons in their social network. The first step to initiate seeking care accounted for 41 \% of the patients’ time to diagnosis while visits to non-TB providers and TB providers (without a TB diagnosis) accounted for 34 \% and 11 \% respectively. New TB patients vs. retreatment (HR: 0.66, 95 \% CI; 1.11, 1.99), those who first contacted a non-TB health provider vs. contacting social network (HR: 0.72 95 \% CI; 0.55, 0.95) and HIV seronegative vs. seropositive patients (HR: 0.70, 95 \% CI; 0.53, 0.92) had a significantly lower likelihood of a timely final diagnosis.
Conclusions: There were four degrees of separation between the onset of symptoms in a TB patient and a final diagnosis. Both social and provider networks of patients influenced the diagnostic pathways. Most delays occurred in the first step which represents decisions to seek help, and through interactions with non-TB health providers. TB control programs should strengthen education and active screening in the community and in health care settings to ensure timely diagnosis of TB.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease with a peculiar feature: Upon infection with the causative agent, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB), most hosts enter a latent state during which no transmission of MTB to new hosts occurs. Only a fraction of latently infected hosts develop TB disease and can potentially infect new hosts. At first glance, this seems like a waste of transmission potential and therefore an evolutionary suboptimal strategy for MTB. It might be that the human immune response keeps MTB in check in most hosts, thereby preventing it from achieving its evolutionary optimum. Another possible explanation is that long latency and progression to disease in only a fraction of hosts are evolutionary beneficial to MTB by allowing it to persist better in small host populations. Given that MTB has co-evolved with human hosts for millenia or longer, it likely encountered small host populations for a large share of its evolutionary history and had to evolve strategies of persistence. Here, we use a mathematical model to show that indeed, MTB persistence is optimal for an intermediate duration of latency and level of activation. The predicted optimal level of activation is above the observed value, suggesting that human co-evolution has lead to host immunity, which keeps MTB below its evolutionary optimum.},

	abstract = {Inoculum dose, i.e. the number of pathogens at the beginning of an infection, often affects key aspects of pathogen and immune response dynamics. These in turn determine clinically relevant outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality. Despite the general recognition that inoculum dose is an important component of infection outcomes, we currently do not understand its impact in much detail. This study is intended to start ﬁlling this knowledge gap by analyzing inoculum dependent patterns of viral load dynamics in acute infections. Using experimental data for adenovirus and infectious bronchitis virus infections as examples, we demonstrate inoculum dose dependent patterns of virus dynamics. We analyze the data with the help of mathematical models to investigate what mechanisms can reproduce the patterns observed in experimental data. We ﬁnd that models including components of both the innate and adaptive immune response are needed to reproduce the patterns found in the data. We further analyze which types of innate or adaptive immune response models agree with observed data. One interesting ﬁnding is that only models for the adaptive immune response that contain growth terms partially independent of viral load can properly reproduce observed patterns. This agrees with the idea that an antigen-independent, programmed response is part of the adaptive response. Our analysis provides useful insights into the types of model structures that are required to properly reproduce observed virus dynamics for varying inoculum doses. We suggest that such models should be taken as basis for future models of acute viral infections.},

	abstract = {Successful replication within an infected host and successful transmission between hosts are key to the continued spread of most pathogens. Competing selection pressures exerted at these different scales can lead to evolutionary trade-offs between the determinants of fitness within and between hosts. Here, we examine such a trade-off in the context of influenza A viruses and the differential pressures exerted by temperature-dependent virus persistence. For a panel of avian influenza A virus strains, we find evidence for a trade-off between the persistence at high versus low temperatures. Combining a within-host model of influenza infection dynamics with a between-host transmission model, we study how such a trade-off affects virus fitness on the host population level. We show that conclusions regarding overall fitness are affected by the type of link assumed between the within- and between-host levels and the main route of transmission (direct or environmental). The relative importance of virulence and immune response mediated virus clearance are also found to influence the fitness impacts of virus persistence at low versus high temperatures. Based on our results, we predict that if transmission occurs mainly directly and scales linearly with virus load, and virulence or immune responses are negligible, the evolutionary pressure for influenza viruses to evolve toward good persistence at high within-host temperatures dominates. For all other scenarios, influenza viruses with good environmental persistence at low temperatures seem to be favored.},

	abstract = {Coronaviruses, which are single stranded, positive sense RNA viruses, are responsible for a wide variety of existing and emerging diseases in humans and other animals. The gammacoronaviruses primarily infect avian hosts. Within this genus of coronaviruses, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly infectious upper-respiratory tract disease in commercial poultry. IBV shows rapid evolution in chickens, frequently producing new antigenic types, which adds to the multiple serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect. Rapid evolution in IBV is facilitated by strong selection, large population sizes and high genetic diversity within hosts, and transmission bottlenecks between hosts. Genetic diversity within a host arises primarily by mutation, which includes substitutions, insertions and deletions. Mutations are caused both by the high error rate, and limited proof reading capability, of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, and by recombination. Recombination also generates new haplotype diversity by recombining existing variants. Rapid evolution of avian coronavirus IBV makes this virus extremely difﬁcult to diagnose and control, but also makes it an excellent model system to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host.},

	abstract = {Background. Noroviruses (NoVs) are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis; however, the relative impacts of individual factors underlying severe illness are poorly understood. This report reviews published NoV outbreak reports to quantify hospitalization and mortality rates and assess their relationship with outbreak setting, transmission route, and strain.
Methods. Using a string of terms related to “norovirus” and “outbreak,” we 2435 nonduplicate articles identiﬁed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge published between January 1993 and June 2011. Inclusion criteria included outbreaks with a minimum of 2 ill persons with a common exposure and at least 1 reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction–conﬁrmed case of NoV disease. Univariate analyses were performed, and multivariable models were ﬁtted to estimate the independent effect of each factor.
Results. We analyzed 843 NoV outbreaks reported in 233 published articles from 45 countries. Based upon 71 724 illnesses, 501 hospitalizations, and 45 deaths, overall hospitalization and mortality rates were 0.54\% and 0.06\%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, genogroup 2 genotype 4 (GII.4) NoV strains were associated with higher hospitalization (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 9.4; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI], 6.1–14.4; P {\textless} .001) and mortality rates (IRR, 3.1; 95\% CI, 1.3–7.6; P = .01). Deaths were much more likely to occur in outbreaks occurring in healthcare facilities (IRR, 60; 95\% CI, 6–109; P = .01).
Conclusions. Our review suggests that hospitalizations and deaths were more likely in outbreaks associated with GII.4 viruses, independent of other factors, and underscores the importance of developing vaccines against GII.4 viruses to prevent severe disease outcomes.},

We explore the symbiotic role of mathematical models and experimental assays in improving our quantitative understanding of influenza infection dynamics. We also discuss the challenges in developing better, more comprehensive models for the course of influenza infections within a host or cell culture.

	abstract = {For many bacterial infections, drug resistant mutants are likely present by the time antibiotic treatment starts. Nevertheless, such infections are often successfully cleared. It is commonly assumed that this is due to the combined action of drug and immune response, the latter facilitating clearance of the resistant population. However, most studies of drug resistance emergence during antibiotic treatment focus almost exclusively on the dynamics of bacteria and the drug and neglect the contribution of immune defenses. Here, we develop and analyze several mathematical models that explicitly include an immune response. We consider different types of immune responses and investigate how each impacts the emergence of resistance. We show that an immune response that retains its strength despite a strong drug-induced decline of bacteria numbers considerably reduces the emergence of resistance, narrows the mutant selection window, and mitigates the effects of non-adherence to treatment. Additionally, we show that compared to an immune response that kills bacteria at a constant rate, one that trades reduced killing at high bacterial load for increased killing at low bacterial load is sometimes preferable. We discuss the predictions and hypotheses derived from this study and how they can be tested experimentally.},

	abstract = {Antiviral drugs, most notably the neuraminidase inhibitors, are an important component of control strategies aimed to prevent or limit any future inﬂuenza pandemic. The potential large-scale use of antiviral drugs brings with it the danger of drug resistance evolution. A number of recent studies have shown that the emergence of drug-resistant inﬂuenza could undermine the usefulness of antiviral drugs for the control of an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. While these studies have provided important insights, the inherently stochastic nature of resistance generation and spread, as well as the potential for ongoing evolution of the resistant strain have not been fully addressed. Here, we study a stochastic model of drug resistance emergence and consecutive evolution of the resistant strain in response to antiviral control during an inﬂuenza pandemic. We ﬁnd that taking into consideration the ongoing evolution of the resistant strain does not increase the probability of resistance emergence; however, it increases the total number of infecteds if a resistant outbreak occurs. Our study further shows that taking stochasticity into account leads to results that can differ from deterministic models. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that rapid and strong control cannot only contain a drug sensitive outbreak, it can also prevent a resistant outbreak from occurring. We ﬁnd that the best control strategy is early intervention heavily based on prophylaxis at a level that leads to outbreak containment. If containment is not possible, mitigation works best at intermediate levels of antiviral control. Finally, we show that the results are not very sensitive to the way resistance generation is modeled.},

	abstract = {Inﬂuenza infections often predispose individuals to consecutive bacterial infections. Both during seasonal and pandemic inﬂuenza outbreaks, morbidity and mortality due to secondary bacterial infections can be substantial. With the help of a mathematical model, we investigate the potential impact of such bacterial infections during an inﬂuenza pandemic, and we analyze how antiviral and antibacterial treatment or prophylaxis affect morbidity and mortality. We consider different scenarios for the spread of bacteria, the emergence of antiviral resistance, and different levels of severity for inﬂuenza infections (1918-like and 2009-like). We ﬁnd that while antibacterial intervention strategies are unlikely to play an important role in reducing the overall number of cases, such interventions can lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in mortality and in the number of bacterial infections. Antibacterial interventions become even more important if one considers the–very likely–scenario that during a pandemic outbreak, inﬂuenza strains resistant to antivirals emerge. Overall, our study suggests that pandemic preparedness plans should consider intervention strategies based on antibacterial treatment or prophylaxis through drugs or vaccines as part of the overall control strategy. A major caveat for our results is the lack of data that would allow precise estimation of many of the model parameters. As our results show, this leads to very large uncertainty in model outcomes. As we discuss, precise assessment of the impact of antibacterial strategies during an inﬂuenza pandemic will require the collection of further data to better estimate key parameters, especially those related to the bacterial infections and the impact of antibacterial intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {Background: It is commonly thought that large asexual populations evolve more rapidly than smaller ones, due to their increased rate of beneficial mutations. Less clear is how population size influences the level of fitness an asexual population can attain. Here, we simulate the evolution of bacteria in repeated serial passage experiments to explore how features such as fitness landscape ruggedness, the size of the mutational target under selection, and the mutation supply rate, interact to affect the evolution of microbial populations of different sizes.
Results: We find that if the fitness landscape has many local peaks, there can be a trade-off between the rate of adaptation and the potential to reach high fitness peaks. This result derives from the fact that whereas large populations evolve mostly deterministically and often become trapped on local fitness peaks, smaller populations can follow more stochastic evolutionary paths and thus locate higher fitness peaks. We also find that the target size of adaptation and the mutation rate interact with population size to influence the trade-off between rate of adaptation and final fitness.
Conclusion: Our study suggests that the optimal population size for adaptation depends on the details of the environment and on the importance of either the ability to evolve rapidly or to reach high fitness levels.},

	abstract = {Background: Small populations are thought to be adaptively handicapped, not only because they suffer more from deleterious mutations but also because they have limited access to new beneficial mutations, particularly those conferring large benefits.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we test this widely held conjecture using both simulations and experiments with small and large bacterial populations evolving in either a simple or a complex nutrient environment. Consistent with expectations, we find that small populations are adaptively constrained in the simple environment; however, in the complex environment small populations not only follow more heterogeneous adaptive trajectories, but can also attain higher fitness than the large populations. Large populations are constrained to near deterministic fixation of rare large-benefit mutations. While such determinism speeds adaptation on the smooth adaptive landscape represented by the simple environment, it can limit the ability of large populations from effectively exploring the underlying topography of rugged adaptive landscapes characterized by complex environments.
Conclusions: Our results show that adaptive constraints often faced by small populations can be circumvented during evolution on rugged adaptive landscapes.},

	abstract = {The ability of microbial populations to increase ﬁtness through ﬁxation of mutants with an increased growth rate has been well described. In experimental studies, this is often the only way ﬁtness can be increased. In natural settings, however, ﬁtness can also be improved by increasing the ability of the microbe to transmit from one host to the next. For many pathogens, transmission includes a phase outside the host during which they need to survive before the chance of reinfecting a new host occurs. In such a situation, a reduced death rate during this phase will lead to improved ﬁtness. Here, we compute the ﬁxation probability of mutants that better survive the transmission bottleneck during the evolution of microbial populations. We derive analytical results that show that transmission mutants are often likely to occur and that their importance relative to growth mutants increases as the population decline during the transmission phase increases. We conﬁrm our theoretical results with numerical simulations and suggest speciﬁc experiments that can be done to test our predictions.},

Based on the statistical and mathematical analysis of vital statistics and morbidity epidemic curves in these two countries, we show that the 1951 epidemic was associated with both higher mortality impact and higher transmissibility than the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Surprisingly in Liverpool, considered the ‘epicenter’ of the severe 1951 epidemic, the mortality impact and transmissibility even surpassed the 1918 pandemic.},
