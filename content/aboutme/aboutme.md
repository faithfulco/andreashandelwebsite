I am currently an Associate Professor in the [Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/epibio/),
[College of Public Health](http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/), at the [University of Georgia](http://www.uga.edu/). 
I also serve as Associate Department Head and Graduate Coordinator and as Director of the Health Systems Modeling Core of UGA's [Health Informatics Institute](http://hii.publichealth.uga.edu/).

My research focuses on analyzing and modeling the spread and control of infectious diseases, mainly influenza, tuberculosis and norovirus. Lately, I have also worked a lot on COVID-19. I uses mathematical models, computational simulations and statistical analysis to understand the dynamics of pathogens on different spatial and temporal scales. The ultimate goal of his work is to help design better intervention and control strategies against infectious diseases, both for individual patients and on the population level.


I have adjunct appointments in UGA's [School of Ecology](https://www.ecology.uga.edu/directory/andreas-handel/) and [Department of Infectious Diseases in the College of Veterinary Medicine](https://vet.uga.edu/person/andreas-handel/), as well as the [Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health](http://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#AHANDEL) at Emory University. I am also a Member of UGA's [Institute of Bioinformatics](http://iob.uga.edu/faculty/) and 
[Faculty of Infectious Diseases](https://fid.uga.edu/directory/).

Before I startedy my faculty position at UGA, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Biology](http://www.biology.emory.edu/) 
at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/) in the group of [Rustom Antia](http://www.biology.emory.edu/Antia/). 
During my Postdoc, I used the mathematical and computational approaches that I learned during my Ph.D. to 
study the dynamics of pathogens, both on the within-host level during individual infections and the between-host, 
population level.

I obtained a Ph.D. in physics from the [Center for Nonlinear Science](http://cns.physics.gatech.edu/) and 
[School of Physics](http://www.physics.gatech.edu/), at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu/). 
I worked with [Roman Grigoriev](http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~roman/) on the topic of localized control of spatially 
extended, nonlinear dynamical systems. 

I grew up in Germany and received my B.S. (or what could be considered the German equivalent) 
from the [Department of Physics](http://www.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/index.en.html) at the 
[University of Stuttgart](http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/).
