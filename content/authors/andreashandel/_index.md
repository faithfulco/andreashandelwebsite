I am currently an Associate Professor in the [Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://publichealth.uga.edu/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics/),
[College of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.uga.edu/), at the [University of Georgia (UGA)](https://www.uga.edu/). 
My research focuses on data analysis and modeling of infectious diseases, mainly influenza, norovirus, tuberculosis and recently COVID-19. 
This website contains some information [about myself](/aboutme/) and my activities (teaching, presentations, blog posts, etc.). 
More details regarding the research done in my group, as well as links to publications, can be found [on my research group site](https://handelgroup.uga.edu/). 
Some overlap between the two sites might occur.
