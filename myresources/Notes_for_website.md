# Website structure
* /config contains toml configuration files, edit as needed
* /content should contain all content in subfolders
* /data contains copies of files in the same folders of /academic which overwrite those. 
* /myresources contains this file and other files I might need for writing the page.
* /public is the folder created by hugo for deployment. Don't edit. This folder is not synced over to github! Netlify automatically pulls the github folder and builds the site using hugo.
* /resources folder seems to be generated by hugo, leave alone
* /static contains my images and files that are linked from other sites.
* /themes folder should contain the /academic theme/folder with all subfolders. Update that to new version as needed.
