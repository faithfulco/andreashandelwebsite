## Ideas for new posts/content

### Science/Research

* Reading/managing/publishing papers: turn my presentation and my text on the 'teaching-research-resources' list into a blog post.


### Teaching/Tech

Review of my technology stack for online courses
  * Github
  * Slack
  * gradingapp
  
* gh_class package to manage class with github and my experience using github for teaching: workflow, exercises

* conceptual thought of usefulness of certain teaching aids like metaphors/examples/jokes that might confuse-enlighten or disengage-engage

* quizgrader description

### Others

* staying mentally in good shape in grad school (and in general)

* comparing mental exercise/meditation to physical exercise, where do analogies work and where do they not
